## Project Description
This project aims to create a hierarchical tree-based index for multi-document, topic, and section-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and develop a question-answering (QA) system using a Language Model (LLM). The hierarchical index allows for efficient retrieval and organization of information across multiple documents and topics, facilitating accurate and relevant answers to user queries.

# Main Features
## Textbook Selection and Content Extraction

Extract content from textbooks and other multi-document sources.
Organize content based on topics and sections.
## Retrieval Techniques

Implement advanced retrieval techniques to fetch relevant information.
Use semantic search for accurate results.
## Multi-Document/Topic/Section-Based RAG

Develop a hierarchical tree-based index to manage information across various documents, topics, and sections.
Utilize RAG to integrate retrieved information with generation capabilities.
## Question Answering

Implement a QA system using an LLM.
Provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.
## User Interface

Develop user-friendly interfaces.
Allow users to interact with the system easily and efficiently.
